## 1. Purpose & Problem Statement

### Problem  
Modern users frequently juggle between utilities like translators, converters, clipboard managers, and search tools. These utilities are often scattered across different apps or browser tabs, causing inefficiencies and context-switching fatigue.

### Solution  
A floating browser extension and desktop utility app that integrates essential tools into a lightweight, always-accessible panel. Designed to reduce cognitive overhead and enhance productivity by combining multiple utilities in a single UX-friendly workspace.

---

## 2. System Overview

The application will consist of:

- A React-based floating UI panel (browser extension or standalone)
- Dockerized architecture with container isolation and orchestration
- Integrations with multiple third-party APIs including Gemini AI

---

## 3. System Design & Architecture

### Design Pattern: Modular Micro-frontend  

Each tool/module is treated as an independent UI and backend service component, enabling:

- Independent development and testing  
- Easy scalability  
- Future plugin/extension capabilities  

### Architectural Layers:

#### A. Frontend (React + TailwindCSS + Chrome Extension APIs)

- Floating overlay popup with shortcut key or extension icon  
- Module components (Clipboard, Converter, etc.) organized as tabs  
- Redux/Context for state management  

#### B. Redis

Cache layer for:

- Weather data (location-based)  
- Translations  
- Recently accessed clipboard items  
- Optional Pub/Sub for real-time sync  

#### C. Docker & Orchestration

Containers:

- Frontend (React)  
- Backend (Express)  
- Redis (caching)  
- `docker-compose.yml` for orchestration and environment isolation
